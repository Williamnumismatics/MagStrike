## 10/23/2025 7 PM - Starteds on the thing and also started on the footprint  

First i started by creating the BOM and the plan file then i started on the footprint since i couldnt find any available footprint for my gateron low profile magnetic jade switch, i decided to make my own i have just done puting the sensor unter the place on the footprint next im going to move to the symbol and filling in the BOM

## 10/23/2025 8 PM - Finished Footprint  

Finished footprint for the magnetic switch was going to put per key rgb but then figured to complex as that would exeed the amp rating of the pico which would force me to use a usb PD breakotu board. Now going to do the symbol for it and then i will start on the schematic

## 10/30/2025 7 PM - Did stabilizer things  

CReated footprints for my stabilizer because i couldnt find them anywhere spent a good 30 minutes trying tho they are the gateron low profile stabilizers.![Screenshot_20251030_191652](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjY0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd4da37fb41f670e5874ec17b6c9456094adc797/Screenshot_20251030_191652.png)
  

## 10/30/2025 8 PM - Started PCB  

Started PCB but ran into a problem where two components in a singular footprint was too close. Had to restart i just finished routing key 14 out of 61.![Screenshot_20251030_205834](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjY1OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9e6da24b95d989336918e66208af9533365db82c/Screenshot_20251030_205834.png)
