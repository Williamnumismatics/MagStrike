## 10/23/2025 8 PM - Finished Footprint  

Finished footprint for the magnetic switch was going to put per key rgb but then figured to complex as that would exeed the amp rating of the pico which would force me to use a usb PD breakotu board. Now going to do the symbol for it and then i will start on the schematic
