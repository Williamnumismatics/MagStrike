## 10/23/2025 7 PM - Starteds on the thing and also started on the footprint  

First i started by creating the BOM and the plan file then i started on the footprint since i couldnt find any available footprint for my gateron low profile magnetic jade switch, i decided to make my own i have just done puting the sensor unter the place on the footprint next im going to move to the symbol and filling in the BOM

## 10/23/2025 8 PM - Finished Footprint  

Finished footprint for the magnetic switch was going to put per key rgb but then figured to complex as that would exeed the amp rating of the pico which would force me to use a usb PD breakotu board. Now going to do the symbol for it and then i will start on the schematic

## 10/23/2025 9 PM - doing the schematic  

finished symbol and Started doing the schematics added 61 switches 4 multiplexers and the rasberry pi pico next wil finish and then move on to pcb stuff.

## 10/24/2025 - near finish shematic  

Finished with footprint and symbol fot the switch now doingthe shematic currently wiring the 61 switches up to some analog multiplexers that go into a rasberry pi pico

## 10/29/2025 9 PM - Fixed ERC  

Ran ERC and fixed problem of the adc_vref not connecting to anything it is fixed now so tommorow i am going to move onto doing the footprints and acual pcb should be ready in about a week :)
warnings are just extra pins

## 10/30/2025 7 PM - Did stabilizer things  

CReated footprints for my stabilizer because i couldnt find them anywhere spent a good 30 minutes trying tho they are the gateron low profile stabilizers.![Screenshot_20251030_191652](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjY0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd4da37fb41f670e5874ec17b6c9456094adc797/Screenshot_20251030_191652.png)
  

## 10/30/2025 8 PM - Started PCB  

Started PCB but ran into a problem where two components in a singular footprint was too close. Had to restart i just finished routing key 14 out of 61.![Screenshot_20251030_205834](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjY1OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9e6da24b95d989336918e66208af9533365db82c/Screenshot_20251030_205834.png)
