# MagStrike

MagStrike is a custom hall effect keyboard that has a 60 percent layout.
It uses the Gateron Low Profile Magnetic Jade Switches. The brains of this keyboard is a Rpi Pico 2 that runs micropython that communicates with a python script running on the main PC/Laptop

## Why did i build this???
I built this keyboard because i have always wanted to make my own keyboard from scratch and when i stumbled across hall-effect one day i quickly fell in love with it. I also wanted to use low profile switches so my wrists wouldnt hurt all day. I Found the perfect switch for this which is the Gateron Low Profile Magnetic Jade switches.

## What did it take?
It took about 2 weeks to build this it is my first every PCB and unfortunately i couldn't find anywhere to place the rasberry pi pico so i had to put it outside the keyboard. I also designed the case without a top plate so it is easy to print and easy to see the insides

## If i did it again what would i do?
 I would probably make a custom devboard with the rp2040 and embed it inside the footprint of the keyboard.
